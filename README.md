# Passenger Data Analysis and Visualization

A Python-based project to analyze and visualize the Titanic passenger dataset using powerful data analysis and visualization libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **NumPy**. The project focuses on exploring the dataset, performing feature engineering, and uncovering key insights through data visualizations.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features like `FamilySize` and `AgeGroup` to enhance insights.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze survival rates, passenger demographics, and fare distributions.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate meaningful charts and plots to visualize patterns and correlations in the dataset.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: For data analysis and preprocessing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization through plots and charts.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data transformation.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset includes the following columns:
- `PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- `Survived`: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
- `Pclass`: Passenger class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third).
- `Name`: Full name of the passenger.
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger.
- `Age`: Age of the passenger.
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard.
- `Ticket`: Ticket number.
- `Fare`: Fare paid for the ticket.
- `Cabin`: Cabin number.
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
